# Vedic Astrology App - AI-Powered Chart Analysis

Welcome to the Vedic Astrology App, a modern and interactive web application for calculating and analyzing Vedic astral charts (Jyotish). The platform offers detailed visual tools and a chat interface with an AI specialist to provide personalized interpretations and answer questions about the generated chart.

This project represents the **frontend** of the application, built with Next.js and TypeScript, and it consumes a backend API for calculations and analysis.

> **Backend:** The backend responsible for astrological calculations and AI logic can be found in the repository: [luizaaca/vedic-app](https://github.com/luizaaca/vedic-app).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Vedic Chart Calculation:** Enter birth data (date, time, and location) to generate an accurate Vedic astral chart.
- **Multiple Chart Views:**
  - **North Indian Style Chart:** A classic diamond-shaped view that highlights the astrological houses.
  - **Zodiac Style Chart:** A circular chart showing the position of planets in the zodiac signs.
- **JSON Data Viewer:** Access all raw astral chart data in a well-structured JSON format, ideal for in-depth study.
- **Chart Downloads:** Easily export the North Indian or Zodiac charts as high-quality JPEG images.
- **Chat with AI Specialist:** Converse with an AI trained to interpret the elements of your chart, provide summaries, analyses, and answer specific questions.
- **Responsive Interface:** Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **React Native WebView Support:** Designed to be seamlessly embedded within a React Native application. It utilizes `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage` to communicate with the native host, enabling features like downloading chart images directly to the user's device.
